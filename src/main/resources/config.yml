# StackMob ${project.version} Configuration file - by antiPerson and contributors.
# If the comments have been removed, you can find a version with comments at https://github.com/Nathat23/StackMob-5/tree/master/src/main/resources
#
# Most options can be customised for specific entity types, for details about this, see the end of this file.
# Asterisk meaning:
# (*) This option cannot be overridden in the 'custom' section at the end of this file.
# (**) The following option requires the use of Paper (https://papermc.io) because the API needed is not in Spigot.
# (***) You can use group names for entities. These are: HOSTILE, ANIMALS, WATER, RAIDER, BOSS
